# Setting up

By convention, python packages that are dependencies of this project are enumerated in `requirements.txt`. Install them all at once with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

CRITICAL: install pywin32 from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20221/pywin32-221.win-amd64-py3.6.exe/download

These installation shenanigans are documented here: https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32/issues/1126
